# SECRET-MESSAGES-WITH-A-BOOK-CIPHER
Encrypts and decrypts messages using a digital novel as a one-time pad.
The Rebecca cipher is a variation of the one-time pad, an unbreakable 
encryption technique that requires a key that is at least the same size as the 
message being sent. Both the sender and receiver have a copy of the pad, 
and after one use, the top sheet is ripped off and discarded.
